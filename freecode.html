        <p>Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera. She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled
            through thousands of images on your computer. She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken. She
            could remember where she had been, what she was thinking as she tried to get the shot, the smells of the
            surrounding area, and even the emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering what she
            had for breakfast.</p>
